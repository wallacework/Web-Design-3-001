               <h2>Bring the Woodlands to Your View</h2>
               <p>Ferns are as attractive as colorful blooms. Most often when we think of a garden, what comes to mind is colorful blooming flowers. </p>
               <p>But, don't forget the beauty of foliage.  <br>
                  Their foliage comes in an abundance of colors, shapes and sizes.
               </p>

                  <img src="img/fern.jpg" alt="Old growth ferns in my garden">

               </div>
               <p>Ferns are graceful and add a frothy exotic splendor, even a sense of mystery, such as a hidden primeval fortress, or an exclusive tropical island. 
               <p>Ferns are an excellent source for decorating. Use them to form  an open wooded grotto, create a decorative border, or fill a shady corner. </p>
               <p>Although they may look frail, most garden ferns can be grown year round because they can withstand both the winter cold and summer heat.</p>
               <p>Planting a growing fern garden requires minimal care and attention. They generally need little more than regular mulching and watering during very dry periods.</p>
               <p>Their true beauty is simply enjoying them as you take a moment of tranquility or a break from your usual routine.    </p>

               <h2>The Lily, Another Garden Stunner</h2>
               <p>The lily is another stunner, I love them because of their regal beauty.  Mine bloom year-after-year.  I divide them every year or so to improve their blooming periods.  They make popular gifts and bouquets and make great gifts. Their bulbs can be planted in your garden, chosen for potted plants to be given as gifts or placed in a room to brighten a table or a corner of a room.  They are excellent choices for bouquets.</p>
               <p>Most lilies are quite fragrant, and are often used in perfumes. Their colors have significant meanings: White lilies symbolize purity and virtue. Pink (stargazer) lilies are said to represent prosperity and abundance. Red lilies symbolize passion. The orange or tiger lily  symbolize confidence, pride, and wealth.  Yellow lilies symbolizes thankfulness and desire for enjoyment.</p>
               <p>In the garden they make excellent beds and border plants, and even as a shrub border.   I've seen some of the smaller varies that fit perfectly in alpine rock gardens, stunning in red and yellow or gold.</p>
               <p>An interesting use of lillies is for skin care products for those with sensitive skin.  The oil extracted from lilies has healing and softening properties. Lily oils are used for massage, as a bath oil, after bath lotions, great for babies soft skins, are used to heal dry cuticles and elbows, as facial moisturizers,  and as under-eye oil and hot-oil treatments.</p>

               <h2>Develop Your Space</h2>
               <p>Change your view with climbing roses. These garden classics can add structure and beauty at the same time.  Create your own natural pillars or columns, borders or decorate a wall using your own garden roses. I've let them cover a fence naturally and pruned them over the years to get a shape I want. </p>
               <p>You can use this growing technique on your own to develop a private pillar or wall covering just for you! </p>
               <p>As your roses twine their way up pillars or the edge of a fence, they tend to weave their way through fences, or simply sprawl out across any garden structure; you will end up with a lovely display! </p>
               <p>Climbing roses are known for blooming out masses of flowers mainly because of their growth habit of holding their blossoms up high for all to see. <br> Most prominently displayed is color, and the second bonus is a spread of fragrance.  Plant a combination of colors to make a stunning display</p>
