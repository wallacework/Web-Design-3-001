			<h2>Workspace Change</h2>
			<p>More and more people are choosing to work from home.  In fact, more than 2 million people  work from home and that figure could easily grow as more people swap the real deal office life for working at home.  The ease and convenience of telecommuting comes with some  drawbacks.  There's that feeling of never really "leaving work". <br> Although I study at home and work at home as an independent, I have the occasional opportunity to work outside. </p>

			<h2>Room With A View</h2>
			<p>Consider the alternative of the garden office. Create for yourself a dedicated work space in your garden. Home yes, yet away from home life and all of its distractions.</p>
			<p>A high-end garden office, however, requires building a space.  Such a plan could be expensive and involve city planners, architects, designers contractors, and even homeowner association restrictions.</p>
			<p>Believe me, I am all low-tech: a folding table, overhead umbrella, a portable insect screen, garden rug, laptap and a power strip, fly swatter and a liter water bottle. My space immediately becomes comfortable and functional.</p>

			<h2>About Having a Room With a View</h2>
			<p>Here's a quote from E.M. Forster
				<blockquote cite="www.goodreads.com/book/show/3087.A_Room_with_a_View">Let yourself go. Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand,and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them.
				<!-- <cite> A Room with a View by E.M. Forster</cite> -->
